    <h2>The Market For Computing Careers (2020)</h2>
    <p>
    If you are visiting this page, then there is a good chance
    that you are a student interested in a career in science,
    technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM).
    What is the job market going to be like when you graduate?
    </p><p>
    Predicting the future is always risky, but when it comes
    to forecasting the U.S. labor market, most people look to the
    <a href="http://www.bls.gov/emp/">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>
    (US-BLS).
    Every year, the US-BLS produces two sets of employment projections
    for the coming decade:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>New Jobs</strong> -- jobs that did not exist previously,
        representing economic growth; and </li>
     <li>
      <strong>Total Job Openings</strong> -- new jobs plus job openings
        to replace people who have retired.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    According to both of these US-BLS projections,
    computing will be the safest STEM career options
    for the foreseeable future.
    The following table presents two charts of these US-BLS projections
    for STEM careers through the year 2028 for side-by-side comparison.
    The left chart presents the US-BLS <em>New Jobs</em> projections
    and the right chart presents their <em>Total Job Openings</em> projections:
    </p><p>
    </p><table>
    <tbody><tr>
    <td>

          <div class="container">
            <svg id= "graph1" width="1250" height="500" style="background-color: lightblue"></svg>
          </div>
    </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
    (Click on either chart for a larger image.)
    </p> <p>
    As you can see from the chart on the left,
    the US government predicts that the top five
    <span class="caps">STEM</span> jobs in terms of growth will all be in computing.
    </p> <p>
    In particular, <strong>the US-BLS predicts that each year,
    there will be nearly 30,000 new software development jobs,
    over 8,000 new computing support jobs,
    over 5,000 new systems analysts jobs,
    over 3,000 information security jobs, and
    over 4,000 other computing jobs.
    </strong>
    No other STEM career is expected to generate even 3000 new jobs per year.
    </p> <p>
    The chart on the right paints a similar picture
    when retiree-replacements are considered:
    the top five STEM careers with the most job opportunities per year are:
    software development, computing support, systems analysts,
    network/systems administration, and
    other computer occupations.
